# Contributing to flins

Thanks for wanting to contribute to [flins](https://github.com/flinstech/flins)!

## Workflow

**Issue first, then PR.**

1. **Create an issue** to discuss what you want to do
2. **Wait for approval** - maintainers will review and provide feedback
3. **Open a PR** - once approved, submit your changes

This prevents wasted work and keeps the codebase consistent.

## Submitting Changes

**Bug reports should include:**

- Expected vs actual behavior
- Steps to reproduce
- Your environment (OS, Node version, etc.)

**Feature proposals should include:**

- Problem it solves
- Your proposed solution
- Any breaking changes

**Pull requests should:**

- Link to a related issue
- Be focused and minimal
- Follow the project's code style
- Pass all CI checks
